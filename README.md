# Fancy Weather API

This is the repository for the Fancy_Weather_API, a Lethal Company API to extend to "fancy weathers" monitor display of the General Improvements popular mod.

This is done by scanning new weathers animations inside txt files and patching General Improvements to inject these animation inside the code.

You can post some suggestions or issues in the 'Issues' tab.

This API was made in collaboration with `@BADQUEST_`.
